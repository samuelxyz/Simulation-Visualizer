Simulates and visualizes rigid body dynamics, using a geometrically implicit time-stepping scheme and formulating the physics as a mixed nonlinear complementarity problem.

Written in C++. Uses OpenGL and the [PATH](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/path.html) solver. Interface is made using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
